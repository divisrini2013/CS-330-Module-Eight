# 3D Scene Project – Computational Graphics and Visualization  
This repository has my finished 3D Scene project and the Design Decisions paper that goes with it. These files show that I can design and build a completely realized 3D world using modular programming, rendering techniques, and camera navigation.
## Project Reflection
As part of this project, I made and sent in a complete 3D scene along with the Design Decisions document. These things show off my skills in computational graphics and visualization, as well as my ability to design and build software with a clear plan in mind.
### How I Approach Designing Software
When I develop software, I start by breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts. I first thought of the entire layout of the 3D scenario for this project. This included the table, the mug, the texturing, and how to move the camera around. I had to think about how each thing would look and how they would all go together in the final arrangement. I learned new design abilities during this process, such modular thinking and making reusable functions to change objects. I used an iterative design method, starting with simple placeholder objects and then changing their shapes, sizes, and places until the scene seemed real. I can use these strategies—starting simple, refining iteratively, and developing modular components—in future initiatives, whether they are in graphics or other areas of software design.
### How I Approach Developing Programs
When I make programs, I try to balance forethought with being able to change things. For this 3D scene, I used modular programming, which means I developed functions to do things like setting transformations over and over again. This not only helped my code look better, but it also made it easier to change later. Iteration was a big element of how I grew as a person. I often tested the scene, moved stuff around, and ran the software again to make sure everything was in the right place. My approach to development changed a lot during the course of the milestones. At first, I only cared about getting things to render right. By the end, though, I had a more disciplined approach that put a lot of emphasis on organization, reusability, and readability. This change highlights how practice and feedback can help you improve your programming skills.
### How Computer Science Helps Me Reach My Goals
This project showed me how computer science skills may help me reach both my academic and career goals. Learning about computer graphics and visualizations helped me learn more about 3D modeling, camera movement, and real-time rendering. These talents can be used in more than just school assignments. They can also be used in game design, architecture, simulation, and data visualization. Creating interactive 3D environments is a skill that is becoming more and more necessary in fields where immersive technology is becoming more and more important. This project also showed me how important it is to be able to solve problems, think in modules, and build iteratively. These are abilities that will help me in any future computer science career I take.
